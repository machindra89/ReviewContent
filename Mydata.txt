Certainly, here's an executive summary tailored to your organization's context:

**Executive Summary:**

In pursuit of an efficient and secure software development lifecycle (SDLC) strategy, our organization currently utilizes SonarQube for code scanning while managing source code in Bitbucket through TeamCity integration. Recognizing the importance of a cloud-based journey, we have recently adopted GitHub as our preferred platform.

The primary goal of this strategic initiative is to optimize our code scanning processes within the banking domain. To achieve this, we propose a transition from SonarQube to CodeQL for enhanced code analysis capabilities. Additionally, we recommend migrating our source code repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub, taking advantage of GitHub's robust features, including code scanning and secret scanning.

This transition will not only streamline our SDLC but also reduce dependencies on external tools, fostering simplicity and efficiency throughout our development lifecycle. By embracing CodeQL and GitHub's integrated security features, we aim to elevate the quality of our code, enhance security measures, and ensure the success of our cloud journey while maintaining the highest standards in banking software development.

The following sections of this report provide a comprehensive analysis of our current state, the benefits and impact of these recommended changes, strategies for implementation, and a roadmap for the short term, medium term, and long term. It is our belief that this strategic shift will position our organization for greater success in the rapidly evolving landscape of software development within the banking industry.

Certainly, here's an introduction for your study report:

**Introduction:**

In the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of software development, financial institutions such as ours face the dual challenge of delivering innovative solutions to customers while maintaining the utmost standards of security and reliability. To excel in this environment, our organization has been utilizing SonarQube for code scanning, Bitbucket as our source code management (SCM) platform, and TeamCity for orchestrating Sonar scanning processes.

As part of our ongoing commitment to excellence and our journey towards embracing cloud-based technologies, we have recently adopted GitHub, a platform renowned for its robust features and versatility in software development. With this adoption, we are presented with a unique opportunity to optimize our code scanning practices, enhance security measures, and simplify our software development lifecycle (SDLC).

This study report serves as a comprehensive guide to our strategic approach towards code scanning in the banking sector. Our primary goal is to seamlessly transition from SonarQube to CodeQL for code analysis, while concurrently migrating our source code repositories from Bitbucket to GitHub. This strategic shift is not merely a change in tools but a deliberate step towards achieving excellence in code quality, security, and agility.

Throughout this report, we will delve into the rationale behind these recommendations, assess the current state of our tools and processes, outline the benefits and impacts of these changes, and provide a roadmap for their implementation. By harnessing the power of CodeQL and GitHub, we aim to elevate our development practices to the highest standards, ensuring that we continue to deliver exceptional software solutions while safeguarding the trust and security of our banking operations.

In the following sections, we will embark on a journey to explore these strategic recommendations in depth, with the ultimate aim of positioning our organization at the forefront of innovative and secure software development in the financial sector.


Mid-Term Recommendation: Implementing Standardized and Mandatory Code Scanning

As a mid-term strategy for this study, it is recommended to introduce a standardized and mandatory code scanning approach across all development teams, focusing on code quality, security, and secret management in line with Non-Access-Related (NAR) criticality. This approach should be seamlessly integrated into the development workflow, making it an automatic part of the process when a pull request (PR) is created and the workflow is initiated for execution.

Key components of this recommendation include:

1. **Standardization**: Establish a standardized set of code scanning criteria that encompasses code quality checks, security assessments, and secret scanning. This set of criteria should be based on NAR criticality levels to prioritize the scanning process effectively.

2. **Mandatory Scanning**: Make code scanning mandatory for all development teams. Every PR must undergo the predefined scanning process as part of the workflow.

3. **Automated Integration**: Implement an automated integration of code scanning tools, including CodeQL for code quality and security checks, as well as secret scanning tools. These tools should be triggered automatically when a PR is created, ensuring consistent and timely assessments.

4. **Immediate Feedback**: If the code scanning process identifies any issues, the workflow should provide immediate feedback to the user responsible for the PR. They are then required to address and rectify any problems or code issues promptly.

5. **Compliance with NAR Criticality**: Ensure that the scanning criteria align with the NAR criticality levels, emphasizing that more critical code areas receive greater scrutiny.

6. **Training and Support**: Provide training and support to development teams to understand and adhere to the new scanning process. This includes guidelines on how to address issues identified during scanning.

By implementing this mid-term recommendation, the organization can enforce a standardized and proactive approach to code scanning that not only enhances code quality and security but also reduces the risk of secrets exposure. It fosters a culture of continuous improvement and accountability among development teams while integrating essential scanning checks seamlessly into the development workflow.
